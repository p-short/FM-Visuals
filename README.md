# FM-Visuals

This is audio-visual piece I put together in c++ oFx was used on the visual side while the audio synthesis was made using the maximilian library

To interact with the piece, simply click anywhere on the window, this will draw an adaptation on the random walks algorithm to the screen
while triggering randomly selected notes quantised to a C minor scale.
